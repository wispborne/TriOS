TriOS Community License v1.0
Last revised 11 May 2025

--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Purpose

This license strikes a balance between open collaboration and protection against wholesale cloning of TriOS. Small, targeted reuse is encouraged under standard open-source terms. Copying large portions or re-branding TriOS as your own requires sharing alike and keeping things free for everyone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Definitions

- "TriOS Source" – any source code, binaries, or documentation distributed by the TriOS project.

- "Limited Use" – incorporating individual files or clearly isolated components (e.g., WispGrid) without substantially re-creating TriOS’s overall functionality or look-and-feel.

- "Extensive Use" – cloning, forking, or otherwise including all or a substantial part of TriOS, or copying one or more complete features with the intent to offer a competing or replacement system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Grant of Rights

Except as modified below, the Apache License 2.0 (the "Apache 2.0") applies to all TriOS Source.

3.1 Limited Use

For Limited Use, you receive all rights granted by Apache 2.0 with no extra obligations.

3.2 Extensive Use

If your use qualifies as Extensive Use, the following additional conditions apply:

  1. Source-Availability – You must make the complete source code of your derivative work publicly accessible under this License (TriOS Community License v1.0) or a later official version of it.

  2. No Closed Forks – You may not distribute or deploy any derivative work under a proprietary or closed-source license.

  3. No Paywalls – You may not charge license fees or usage fees for the derivative work itself. (Selling support, hosting, or related services is fine.)

Failure to meet these extra conditions automatically reclassifies your activity as unlicensed copying.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Disclaimer & Liability

THE TRIOS SOURCE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, AS SET FORTH IN APACHE 2.0 SECTIONS 7 AND 8. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OF THE TRIOS SOURCE.
