# 1.0.0
- Added
  - **Mod Catalog**
    - Browse & download mods from the Official Forum and the Unofficial Discord.
    - Same mods as here: https://starmodder2.pages.dev
  - **VRAM Estimator** polish
    - Now displayed on the Mods tab.
    - Now remembered across restarts.
    - You may now estimate one mod at a time.
    - Shows VRAM taken by your GraphicsLib settings for mods. 
  - **Onboarding** popup on first launch.
    - Prompts for game location and how many versions of each mod to keep.
  - **Mod Grid rewritten** from scratch.
    - Improved performance.
    - Saves column width, position, and sorting.
    - Switched to reuse my old SMOL code and away from the 3rd-party library :)
  - May now install a mod from folder, not just from zip/7z/rar.
    - Either drag'n'drop a folder or select the `mod_info.json` file from the Add button.
- Fixed
  - Mod grid no longer resets itself constantly.
    - e.g. sorting now works.
  - Mod download notification url can't show more than 3 lines anymore.
  - Creating a new mod profile now uses your current mods.
  - TriOS update notification shows download size before downloading and doesn't endlessly animate.
  - Delete Mods not working.
  - Logfile not properly rolling over at 25MB until app restart.
  - Mods folder path used `/` instead of `\`.
- Changed
  - Note: TriOS settings have been reset due to a new format. 
    - Mod profiles should be fine. 
  - "Launch" button now reacts to clicks a bit faster and is more clear that the game's running.
  - Mod Audit Log on Profiles page is now persisted across restarts.
  - Starsector log shown on the Dashboard now automatically refreshes when the game closes.
    - And shows when it was last refreshed.
  - Slightly faster + more reliable VRAM checker thanks to @deliagwath.
    - No longer re-parsing `mod_info.json` files every time.
  - TriOS log button now opens folder instead of file.

# 0.3.4
- Added
  - **Weapon browser** (in Toolbox dropdown).
    - Includes spoilers for modded weapons!
- Fixed
  - `__MACOSX` folders breaking mod installs.
    - e.g. Diktat Enhancement.
  - More Google Drive handling fixes
    - Thank you to @DRE4DNOUGHT for all these bug reports!
  - Mod installs sometimes failing if they required user input (dialog window) and took a long time.
    - e.g. AotD or any other mod that uses google drive.

# 0.3.3
- Added
  - Now checks if the game is running and disables mod changes through TriOS.
  - Setting to switch to a newly updated version of a mod automatically.
- Fixed
  - Some Google Drive downloads not working (if they didn't link directly to the download).
- Changed
  - Downloads now show up immediately when clicked.
    - Before, it would wait until it retrieved the file name, which in the case of Google Drive, could take a while.
  - Combined two http calls into one (get file name + check if there is a file to download).
    - Should slightly speed up download of mods that use Google Drive (e.g. AotD).
  - Now reads the game's version directly from `starfarer_obf.jar`, rather than from your log file.
    - This fixes rare cases where the logfile has a different version than the game (e.g. right after updating), or has none (e.g. right after installing).

# 0.3.2
- Fixed
  - Removed "work in progress" tooltip on Mod Profiles tab.

# 0.3.1
- Fixed 
  - Forgot to enable Mod Profiles.

# 0.3.0
- Added
  - **Mod Profiles**
  - Tooltip when launching game showing version, Java version, and RAM assigned.
  - "Dependents" in the side panel now shows any specific version wanted.
  - Installing a zip with multiple mods inside now shows the paths of each detected mod to make it easier to figure out which one you want.
- Fixed
  - Timeout when checking for mod updates in some cases (tons of mods, slow PC, spotty internet).
    - TriOS now has a max of 10 API requests active at a time, rather than sending one per mod all at once.
    - Switched to a new HTTP client (wrapper around the native one), so let me know if network calls regress.
    - New setting to control this added to Settings page.
  - "Cannot write to vmparams file Miko_R3.txt" error when not using JRE 23.
  - Mod version dropdowns sometimes breaking.
    - Caused by dirty state and equality comparison comparing the whole object. Now compares just ids.
- Changed
  - Roboto as default text theme again, instead of Ibm Plex Sans.
    - It's clearer at small sizes.

# 0.2.7
- Added
  - Option to never rename mod folders (requested by Nissa).
    - CAUTION: You probably don't want to use this. If you install a new mod version and there's a folder name conflict, it'll overwrite data.
    - The UI for is it pretty dirty, will change it to a dropdown menu later.
    - Help I can't stop playing Satisfactory.
- Fixed
  - TriOS logfile button not working.
  - Starsector logfile button not working.
  - No longer warned if you have a newer dependency than a mod wants.
    - e.g. If a mod requires MagicLib 1.0.0 and you have 1.1.0, it will no longer warn you.
  - When installing a mod update, no longer overwrites previous version if "Rename all mod folders" is unchecked and previous version folder name has its name set by TriOS.
    - e.g. If you have a folder `Tahlan Shipworks-1.2.3` and update to a new version of Tahlan, it would put the new version in `Tahlan Shipworks-1.2.3` and delete the actual 1.2.3.
    - Now, if this is detected, it uses whatever the new version's folder is in the .zip file (e.g. `Tahlan Shipworks`) and doesn't change the older version.

# 0.2.6
- Fixed
  - Mod Profiles tab being accidentally enabled. The feature isn't ready yet.

# 0.2.5
- Added
  - Launch precheck now warns about mods incompatible with the current game version.
    - It also gives you a button to force-update their game version. 
- Fixed
  - Launch precheck warned about dependencies because of different versions that were still probably compatible.
    - Now only warns if there's a more serious version mismatch (and the dependency requires a specific version).
    - For example, if a mod requires MagicLib 1.0.0 and you have 1.0.1, it won't warn you, but if you only have 0.9.9, it will.

# 0.2.4
- Changed
  - May now bypass the launcher precheck, or turn it off in Settings.

# 0.2.3
- Added
  - If a dependency is missing, a button with a fix appears.
    - If dependency is disabled, button enables it.
    - If not found, searches Google for it.
    - **No longer automatically enables dependencies nor disables mods with unmet dependencies.**
- Fixed
  - Delete now tries to permanently delete if moving to Trash/Recycle Bin fails.
  - Game launch precheck didn't seem to be working.
- Changed
  - "Admin required" warning now shows a bit more info about what the issue is.

# 0.2.2
- Fixed
  - Crash introduced in 0.2.0 that could happen if an invalid tab was selected.
  
# 0.2.1
- Added
  - **Self-update for Linux and MacOS**.
    - MacOS doesn't automatically restart after updating.
  - When running as Admin, shows a shield icon in the toolbar notifying you that drag'n'drop won't work.
- Fixed
  - Scanner for mod changes on disk broke sometimes when a file was deleted.
- Changed
  - Moved VRAM and Portraits tools into a new dropdown menu to save space on the toolbar.

# 0.2.0
- Added
  - **Retain last N versions** of a mod.
    - Keep only the latest version of a mod by setting this to 1.
  - Option to keep the **same folder name when updating** a mod.
    - This is the new default. It is useful for modders who create a dependency on a folder path and don't want that path to change. 
- Fixed
  - Self-update failed if there were any non-ASCII characters in the TriOS or temp folder paths.
    - The Windows self-updater now works completely differently, doing an in-place update with no .bat script.
    - Windows, you so crazy.
- Changed
  - Incompatible mods are now dimmed on the Dashboard.
  - Tab bar cleanup. More compact, **icons won't be cut off** if narrow, Settings moved again.
  - Settings page always shows the scrollbar to make it more obvious that there are more settings.
  - Deleting a mod now sends it to the recycling bin/trash, rather than permanently deleting it.
  - Added timer to error logging so duplicate errors don't eat my quota.

# 0.1.10
- Fixed
  - RAM changer error if current RAM is set to an invalid number.
  - More rare/internal error fixes.
- Changed
  - White flashbang on startup is now black.
  - Cleaner error messages when a download fails.

# 0.1.9
- Added
  - Troubleshooting option to redownload and reinstall a mod, if direct download is supported.
  - Prettified tooltips if mod has an icon.
- Fixed
  - Non-ASCII characters in file paths causing mod installation to fail.
  - Another source of error spam, hopefully.
- Changed
  - Dashboard mod listing now shows versions on the right, making the mod name easier to read.

# 0.1.8
- Added
  - Mod Audit Log in the Profiles tab shows when mods are enabled/disabled and why.
  - "I don't believe you" option for if the TriOS self-updater says there's no update but you know there is.
  - Context menu option to change mod version on the Dashboard tab.
- Fixed
  - Version Checker updates failing if there was a certificate error (specifically sc2mafia.com).
  - When installing a new version of a mod while another version was enabled, both would end up enabled.
    - Now, the newly installed one will be disabled (unless you select Enable on the notification that appears).
  - If a file failed to extract, the mod install wouldn't fail and you'd have to check the log to know some file was missed.
    - Now, a dialog will appear with the error message as well as buttons to open the folders for manual install.
- Changed
  - Shiny new version comparison algorithm that takes into account dev/alpha/beta/rc, plus a ton of weird edge cases modders love putting in.
    - Nes and Timid, wtf.
  - When a mod is disabled, now sets all mod info files to `mod_info.json` instead of `mod_info.json.disabled`.
    - This improves compatibility with MOSS and manual mod management.
    - The only time `mod_info.json.disabled` is needed is when you want to enable one version and you have others installed.
  - Mod details panel is now cooler looking for mods with icons.

# 0.1.7
- Added
  - New prerelease update channel.
    - Updates will go to the prerelease channel first, then to the stable channel after.
    - You can switch between channels in the Settings page.
    - This lets me test bug fixes and hopefully catch catastrophic bugs early.
  - More info shown in the install dialog, now shows all mod_info.json info.
- Fixed
  - Maybe fixed a crash due to Chipper's parsing thread and the UI thread fighting over the same file.
  - Mod ending up disabled after updating and enabling them.
  - Version checker wasn't ignoring mods without a .version file, so if it misidentified the highest version of a mod, which didn't have a .version file, it wouldn't look for a different version with one.
    - tldr: version checking is more reliable for certain weird cases.
  - Mods showing enabled in the Dashboard modlist even when disabled (happened when enabled in `enabled_mods.json` but the mod info file was `mod_info.json.disabled`).
- Changed
  - Condensed toolbar, which was getting bloated.
  - Renamed log file to `TriOS-log.log` instead of `latest.log`.
    - (will show up as only `TriOS-log` if you have file extensions hidden, which is the Windows default)

# 0.1.6
- Added
  - More info shown in the the install dialog, now shows all mod_info.json info.
- Fixed
  - Some logspam that's blowing up my error reporting data quota.

# 0.1.5
- Added
  - "Delete Mod" context menu item.
  - "Edit mod_info.json" context menu item.
  - "Open Folder" menu item now shows all versions installed.
  - "Dependents" info in the mod details panel, showing which mods depend on the selected mod.
  - About page on toolbar.
  - Shortcut to open Starsector folder on toolbar, which is getting a little crowded (but moved JRE tab off the toolbar, see below).
- Fixed
  - Chipper log viewer not correctly condensing consecutive lines.
  - MacOS LibArchive path (i.e. MacOS should work now).
  - MacOS grey screen if unable to create log file.
    - Now falls back to only console output if cannot create log file.
    - Also, now uses AppData on Windows and Library/Application Support on MacOS for the log file.
      - This avoids permissions issues to create the log file.
  - Freeze+crash when installing mods and the dialog came up (either multiple mods at once or reinstalling a mod).
  - Grey screen if using an old TriOS version after using a newer one that added a new setting.
    - Will reset settings to default if this happens, after making a backup.
  - Mod grid showed mods as Enabled incorrectly sometimes.
    - The "enabled" checked `enabled_mods.json`, but didn't check whether TriOS disabled the `mod_info.json` file.
  - Force Game Version didn't work for mods that were disabled and had multiple versions (i.e. had `mod_info.json.disabled-by-TriOS`).
  - Incorrect sorting in same cases (e.g. LazyLib `2.0` and `2.0b`).
    - Now sorts using `.version` file first, then by `mod_info.json`'s version with everything but numbers and periods removed, and finally by `mod_info.json`'s version without anything removed.
  - Toolbar icons needing to be scrolled to unnecessarily.
- Changed
  - Moved the JRE tab into the Dashboard.
  - Mods tab: in the version selector, `versions are a different color if they are for a different version of the game.`
  - Disabled mods with multiple versions will now use `mod_info.json.disabled` instead of `mod_info.json.disabled-by-TriOS`.
    - It's less obvious now why it's called `.disabled`, but it makes it cross-compatible with SMOL.
  - "Skip Game Launcher" is now disabled by default, since it can cause very weird issues.
    - e.g. zoomed-in combat, no Windows title bar, invisible ships.
  - Improved toolbar icons for game folder, changelog, and log file.

# 0.1.4
- Added
  - Drag'n'drop now supports urls. Drag a url from your browser and it'll download and install the mod.
- Fixed
  - (Hopefully fixed) Self-update and installing mods not working for some users 
    - Error mentioned system32, I swear that's some null fallback path, I don't touch that.
  - Notification timers resetting.
  - Notifications could time out when still downloading a mod.

# 0.1.3
- Fixed
  - Internal error when switching from JRE 23 to any other.
  - "Admin permission required" warning if not using JRE 23.
    - And added more info about what the issue is if the warning does appear.
- Changed
  - Settings page is now scrollable.
  - Polished "Debugging" section in Settings a little.

# 0.1.2
- Fixed
  - Bugs where sometimes UI wouldn't update after changing out a mod  (found using error reporting).
  - Instance of launcher breaking if unable to read default game settings from registry (found using error reporting).
  - Portrait Viewer: Error if unable to get image size (found using error reporting).

# 0.1.1

        - Not enabled by default.

        - Example of the report I see: https://i.imgur.com/k9E6zxO.png.
        - Generates a random id for you, so I can tell if 10 of the same error is from 10 people or 1 person.
        - This will help me find bugs that may otherwise not get reported.
    - Changelog viewer, for mods that include a link to a changelog in their .version files.
    - When a mod is added, shows a notification allowing you to enable it.
        - Bonus: if the mod has an icon, the notification is themed (lol).
    - Portrait Viewer. 
      - Can't yet change portraits; decided to work on Mod Profiles next instead of finishing this.
    - Added write permission check for vmparams.
- Fixed
    - Dashboard: Hide the Updates section if there aren't any updates.
    - Chipper: Handled error if a folder is dropped instead of a file.
    - When updating a mod, the new version is no longer automatically enabled.
        - Click "Enable" in the notification that appears.
        - This is to allow you to update a mod but still decide whether to use the update (it may be save-breaking).
    - Hide the "Skip Game Launcher" option if using JRE 23 (thanks Zon).
    - Checks for when a mod is "enabled" in `enabled_mods.json` but the mod doesn't actually exist anymore.
    - Checks to ensure sliders on Settings page can't break the page if value is invalid.
- Changed
  - Notifications disappear after a configurable amount of time.

    - Some light theme fixes.
- Changed
    - Dashboard: tooltip moved to top-left of cursor to avoid it hiding the mod list so much.
    - Now caches icon paths, should be a little faster when scrolling mods.

# 0.0.57

- Fixed
    - Broken Mods tab (grey screen).
    - YOU WERE SEEING THE WRONG THEME THIS WHOLE TIME?!
        - Toolbar icons are now aligned properly and other little UI things now look the way I've been seeing them this whole time.
    - First install now sets the mods folder correctly.
- Changed
    - Checks for mod folder changes every 15 seconds instead of every 5.
        - Always checks whenever TriOS is re-focused (i.e. you switch back to it).

    - Letters in mod versions are no longer ignored by Version Checker.
    - Dashboard: First mod in "Updates" wasn't shown.

- Fixed
    - JRE manager failing if JRE 23 isn't present.
