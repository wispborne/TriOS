  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/chipper/
    - assets/windows/libarchive/bin/
    - assets/macos/libarchive/bin/
    - assets/macos/libarchive/lib/
    - assets/linux/libarchive/lib/
    - assets/SMOL_Themes.json
    - assets/common/
    - assets/windows/7zip/
    - assets/linux/7zip/arm64/
    - assets/linux/7zip/x64/
    - assets/macos/7zip/
    - assets/common/TriOS-Mod/
    - assets/common/TriOS-Mod/jars/
#    - assets/common/TriOS-Mod/data/config/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Orbitron
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Orbitron-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Orbitron-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 900
        - asset: assets/fonts/Orbitron-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Orbitron-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 400
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
